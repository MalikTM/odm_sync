HogWarp - Time and Weather Sync
--
That's my personal sync script with useful features. 

Usage:
--
- Config.lua for weather and sync settings
- staff_data/staff_config.lua to set yourself as an admin ( put your discord id )

Features:
--
- Sync weather and time from the server to the client
- Sync time/season/weather as the IRL one.
If you decide not to sync your weather/time/season with the IRL one, you can personalize everything from the config and choose your favourite settings. Once the server goes down it will save the latest time (h/min) in a .json file. It will restore the same hour when you start it again. (Cute isn't it?)

- Sort of primitive staff system
- Change time/season/weather with commands in game chat (Put yourself as admin first)
- See your coords in game with ?coords

Known Issues:
--
Some phrases on locale.lua are missing for other languages. Only IT is completed.

Compatible with HogWarp 0_4_0 and latest server version
